I found the box shadow documentation, and read it. In it I found that I can invert the shadow effect with the inset parameter.

I also applied blur to it.

I was trying to align my items vertically again, and I changed my .card css class. I found that I had to use "align-items: center" instead of "align-content: center". This messed up some of the previously corretly made content, but it was necessary.
I added "flex-direction: column" where I needed to fix the layout of a single block.

After that I tried to vertically align the text of the first block, so I used the "display: flex" attribute and I found that my :after line appeared. It wasn't in the right place, because it was next to my name and not under it, but using "flex-direction: column" I could fix that. I still had to use "justify-content: center" to pull them vertically in the middle.
It wasn't in the right place, it was on the left side and using text-align or justify-content didn't help now, so I used "margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" which centered the line.
With this I managed to fix the first block of the page.
